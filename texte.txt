"It is an excellent solution to finding videos and following people that has similar interests as ourselves. Also, it is an excellent solution to rediscovering ourselves within any environment of our society, given that we respect the environment of our society whether it be in public view or private view."

IT A GREAT APP AND FUN TO USE! HOWEVER ARBITRARY ALGORITHMS BLOCKING / BANNING / TAKEDOWNS ETC Alleged Reports the Reporter must be able to back their Report with Evidence or Evidence must be acquired before ACTION!!! ..EVIDENCE IS REQUIRED BEFORE UNCORROBORATED REPORT[S] wreck A Persons Rep / Account! -If IS INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT THEN PROVE IT ..NEEDS FAR BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE ONLINE AND PHONE U KNOW PHONE These apps are great but these but where invented for people to Talk to each other.

I was so upset the app wouldn't let me edit them after a certain point & deleted the first 4 clips so I ended up w/ only the last 17seconds of the video. Please fix that so our hard work doesn't come up missing & we can't get it back. Otherwise 5 stars for now.

"Love the app, the downside is the promotion fixture, the guidelines reasons use by some individuals against creators unnecessary reported also duets and reactions videos violations, it doesn't make sense we have been punished for something that happened in 2018 and we didn't have any knowledge of it. Thank you for your time. Kind regards ðŸ¥°"
